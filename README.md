This is my solution to the AFS .Net Developer Test.

I chose to work with SQLite as persistance store since its free and doesnt require installations

As a result i could not add a stored procedure as SQLite doesnt work with stored procedures but User Functions

Once again, thank you for the opportunty and hope to speak with you soon
